        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Harriet Tubman was an American abolitionist and political activist, who is widely known for helping enslaved people escape through the Underground Railroad. After leading herself to freedom in Philadelphia, she made several trips back to the south, as she led her family, friends, and others to freedom.</p>
